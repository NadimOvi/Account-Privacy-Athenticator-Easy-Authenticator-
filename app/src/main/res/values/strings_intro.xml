    <string name="intro_slide1_desc">Welcome to <b>Easy Authenticator</b>! This wizard will guide you through
        the initial setup process. Please pay attention and read carefully in order to avoid losing data.
        \n\nDon\'t worry, you can still change any of these options later on in the <b>Settings</b>.</string>

    <string name="intro_slide2_desc">To ensure the security of your accounts, <b>Easy Authenticator</b> uses
        encryption to store account data. Here you can choose which method of encryption will be
        used.</string>
    <string name="intro_slide2_desc_keystore">The KeyStore is a system component of Android used to
        securely store cryptographic keys. The advantage of using the KeyStore is that the keys are
        stored separately from <b>Easy Authenticator</b>\'s data, and can be backed by hardware-based encryption
        (if your device supports it). However, as the keys are not stored with <b>Easy Authenticator</b>\'s data,
        <b>this method prevents external backup solutions (like Titanium) from working</b>. If you
        choose this method, you will have to rely on the internal backup functions provided by
        <b>Easy Authenticator</b>.\n\n<b>Warning</b>: The KeyStore is known to cause many problems, so
        please only use it if you absolutely have to. If you don\'t mind entering a password / PIN
        every time you start <b>Easy Authenticator</b>, it is <b>highly recommended to use the password-based
        encryption instead</b>.</string>
    <string name="intro_slide2_desc_password">This method will encrypt your data with a key
        generated from a password or PIN. The main advantage of using this method is that external
        backup solutions (like Titanium) will work as expected, and it is much less failure-prone
        than the KeyStore. However, you will have to enter your credentials every time you start
        <b>Easy Authenticator</b>.</string>

    <string name="intro_slide3_desc_keystore">Here you can setup an authentication method to lock
        <b>Easy Authenticator</b>. Since you have chosen <b>Android KeyStore</b> as your encryption method, this
        step is optional.</string>
    <string name="intro_slide3_desc_password">Here you can setup an authentication method to lock
        <b>Easy Authenticator</b>. Since you have chosen <b>Password / PIN</b> as your encryption method, a
        password or a PIN must be set to proceed.</string>
    <string name="intro_slide3_warn_no_password">Please set a password to continue!</string>
    <string name="intro_slide3_warn_no_pin">Please set a PIN to continue!</string>
    <string name="intro_slide3_warn_confirm_password">Please confirm your password to continue!</string>
    <string name="intro_slide3_warn_confirm_pin">Please confirm your PIN to continue!</string>

    <string name="intro_slide4_title">Finished</string>
    <string name="intro_slide4_desc">Your settings have been saved, you are now all set to use
        <b>Easy Authenticator</b>!</string>
